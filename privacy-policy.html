        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

        <p>Wrapped ("we," "our," or "the app") is an iOS application developed by Ryan Nakajima. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Wrapped displays your Spotify listening statistics. We access only the data necessary to provide this functionality. We do not sell your data, we do not use advertising, and we do not track you across other apps or websites.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Authorization and Consent</h2>
        <p>Wrapped requires you to authorize access to your Spotify account using Spotify's official OAuth 2.0 authentication system. When you tap "Connect with Spotify," you are redirected to Spotify's login page where you can review the specific permissions requested.</p>
        <p>By authorizing the connection, you consent to Wrapped accessing the following data from your Spotify account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Spotify user ID and display name</li>
            <li>Your recently played tracks</li>
            <li>Your top tracks and top artists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not receive or store your Spotify password. Authentication is handled entirely by Spotify, and we only receive a secure access token to retrieve your data.</p>
        <p>You may revoke this authorization at any time through your <a href="https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/" target="_blank">Spotify Account Settings</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide the app's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spotify Profile Data:</strong> Your Spotify user ID and display name, used to identify your account within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Listening History:</strong> Your recently played tracks, including track names, artist names, album names, and timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Top Content:</strong> Your top tracks and top artists as determined by Spotify's API.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Spotify password or payment information</li>
            <li>Your location data</li>
            <li>Your contacts, photos, or other device data</li>
            <li>Device advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
            <li>Any data from other apps on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying your personalized listening statistics</li>
            <li>Showing your top artists, tracks, and listening trends</li>
            <li>Generating charts and visualizations of your listening habits</li>
            <li>Storing your listening history so you can view it across app sessions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data for any other purpose. We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, or profiling.</p>

        <h2>4. Tracking and Advertising</h2>
        <p>Wrapped does <strong>not</strong> track you. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or use the iOS Advertising Identifier (IDFA).</li>
            <li>We do not track your activity across other companies' apps or websites.</li>
            <li>We do not use any third-party advertising services.</li>
            <li>We do not use third-party analytics services.</li>
            <li>We do not participate in data brokers or sell your information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because we do not engage in any form of tracking, Wrapped does not display the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission prompt. This is fully compliant with Apple's ATT framework requirements.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Wrapped integrates with one third-party service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spotify:</strong> We use the Spotify Web API to access your listening data with your explicit authorization. Spotify's collection and use of your data is governed by <a href="https://www.spotify.com/privacy" target="_blank">Spotify's Privacy Policy</a>. Wrapped accesses Spotify data in accordance with the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/terms" target="_blank">Spotify Developer Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share your personal data with any other third parties.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All network communication uses HTTPS encryption (TLS).</li>
            <li>Spotify access tokens are stored securely in the iOS Keychain, which provides hardware-backed encryption.</li>
            <li>Server-side data is stored in access-controlled databases.</li>
            <li>We do not store your Spotify password.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we take reasonable precautions, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active accounts:</strong> Your listening history and profile data are retained for as long as your account remains active and you continue to use the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> If you request deletion of your account, all personal data associated with your account will be permanently deleted from our servers within 30 days of the request.</li>
            <li><strong>Revoked access:</strong> If you revoke Spotify access, we will no longer be able to sync new data. Previously synced data will remain until you request deletion.</li>
            <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Logging out of the app removes authentication tokens from your device. You may also delete the app to remove all local data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your data within the app at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting us at the email address below. We will process deletion requests within 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> You may revoke Wrapped's access to your Spotify account at any time through your <a href="https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/" target="_blank">Spotify Account Settings</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Upon request, we can provide you with a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided below.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Wrapped is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</li>
            <li>For significant changes, we will provide notice within the app.</li>
            <li>Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
